			Dear Ms. Gianetti:<br>
			As you may know, our office is moving to a new location at 1837 Plymouth Avenue (across the street from the Bailey supermarket). Construction is finally complete, and we will begin seeing patientsthere on Monday, May 2.<br>
			The new location offers twice as many as parking spaces, more examination rooms, and a larger waiting room than the old office on Eastbridge Road did. In order to accommodate an increase in the number of patients, our new schedule will offer weekend appointments and longer hours during the workweek; we will now be open 8 A. M. - 6 P. M. , Monday - Friday, and 10 A. M. - 3 P. M. , on Saturday. We are also welcoming two additions to our staff: Dr. Anne Hui, who has been practicing dentistry for over ten years, and Ellen Howard, our new dental assistant.<br>
			For detailed directions to the new location, see the enclosed map. Please note that Exit 9 is the nearest exit if you are driving on the Benson Highway. The nearest light rail station is Grosvenor Street.<br>

							Barrault Bondy Executive<br></p>
				February 10 - Recent movement of executivesamong the fashion industry's leading companies appears not to be ending anytime soon. Hochstein Shoes, Inc. , Swiss-based retailer and manufacturer of men's shoes, announced today that its chief executive officer, Gerard Hullot, will retire, and that Angelica Ferrara, current executive vice-president of Barrault Bondy, will take his place.
				Experts say the succession represents a major upset within the industry, since Barrault Bondy, the Paris-based manufacturer, is one of Hochstein's leading competitors in the high-end shoe market.<br>
				Hullot's departure come as little surprise, however. He had publicly indicated his desire to retire in order to write a memoir of his long career in fashion, over thirty years of which were spent at Hochstein. Nevertheless, most experts had expected him to stay on until after November, when the company's winter collection is released.<br>
				Ferrara's move has generated much speculation about who will take her place at Barrault Bondy. Sources there indicate that current design director Marcel Hugo will be named the new executive vice president in a press release later this week.<br>

				Denver, CO 80210<br>
				Dear Mr. Shaw:<br>
				I enjoyed our meeting last week. I know of no other non-profit organization that performs such a vital service for all-natural agriculture as yours does, and I am enthusiastic aboutthe prospect of the Crockett center working with Integral Harvest.<br>
				As you know, the Crockett Center has recently turned its attention to urban gardening. On this front, the main priorities are to expand existing community gardens in Austin and to found new ones in neighborhoods currently lacking them. Therefore, I would like toproceed with the gardening classes we discussed in our meeting, to be taught on-site by Integral Harvest representatives and attended by Austin community residents. If you will let me know your representatives' availability for teaching the classes and also the range of topics they will cover, I can prepare a class schedule and generate interest in it among residents. My assistant, Cindy Reed, will call you shortly for this information.<br>
				As for your proposal that Integral Harvest representatives demonstrate organic gardening to elementary school students here in Austin, since our meeting I have spoken with several school administrators. It seems that a number of the schools have gardening clubs, so students and teachers alike should make a receptive audience. Let us discuss this proposal further in our next meeting, which Ms. Reed will schedule.<br>
				I am sure that, if our two organizations work together, we can do much to promote urban gardening as a rewarding and healthful endeavor.<br>
				Yours sincerely,<br>

			December 12 - in cooperation with the National Consumer Safety Council, Zorynth Cycle announces a voluntary recall of the Grand Vista mountain bike, batch number 34199. According to the results of factory testing, the rubber used in the tires with which this batch was fitted is subject to prematurewear. This in turn may cause tires to leak air.
			Grand Vista bicycles produced in batch 34199 qualify for free tire replacement, to be performed at the dealer where the purchase was made. The majority of bicycles from batch 34199 were sold at Ellenbroek Sports locations, with a few hundred being sold through other dealers. To determine whether a Grand Vista is eligible under this recall, simply look for the batch number imprinted on the underside to the frame near the seat.

			<p class="cen">Historic Cinema Reopens</p>
			November 10 - After years of disuse, the historic Croton Theater in Hollywood will reopen as the new location of the Metropolitan Film Society's repertory cinema. <br><br>

			The Croton is one of the most architecturally significant cinemas in the country, according to society president Molly Harris. Built in 1925, it features a facade designed in the Art Deco style and an interior with ornate carvings and a 10-meter-high ceiling. <br><br>

			Since purchasing the building two years ago, the society has embarked on extensive renovations "We have restored the building to its former grandeur, " said Harris. "But we have also modernized it, from the plumbing all the way to the digital projectors. " <br><br>

			According to Harris, the society is moving because its original site on Vine Street was no longer large enough. "Our audience sizes have increased in recent years, and the Croton will allow us to screen classics and important new films in the setting they deserve. "<br>
			The Society's administrative offices have already moved to the new location, and its cinema schedule resumes on Saturday, December 3, with a selection of films by Jack Dodge, director of such classic westerns as A Calico Wedding Dress and Slow Train to Tucson.<br>
			For Harris, the choice of Dodge was crucial for the reopening. "When he moved to Hollywood as a young man, his first job was as a projectionist at this very cinema. Years later he premiered what is now his best-known film,Dust on the Horizon, here. He even ran the projector for old times' sake. Few people have heard of his connection to the Croton, but I think of it every time I step inside the building. "<br>
