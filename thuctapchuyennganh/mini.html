	<p>Children differ (1) <input type="text" id="q1"> . in their mathematical (2)<input type="text" id="q2">. In fact, some children cannot routinely add or subtract, even after extensive schooling. This new paper proposes that math disability arises from (3)<input type="text" id="q3">. in brain areas supporting procedural memory. Procedural memory is a learning and memory (4)<input type="text" id="q4">. that is crucial for the automatization of non-conscious skills, such as driving or grammar.</p>

	<p>In the summer of 1945, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill’s approval (5)<input type="text" id="q5">. was understandably high. He’d just led the Allies to victory in Europe, and politicians and commentators confidently (6)<input type="text" id="q6">. that he would lead the Conservatives to victory at the forthcoming (7)<input type="text" id="q7">. election. Yet those who anticipated Conservative victory were shocked when the Labour Party won the House of Commons in a landslide, costing Churchill his office.</p>
